This project initially aimed to create a single AI assistant but evolved into a team of AI assistants, each with their own expertise and skills. The AI model, developed from scratch, offers advice on data science and AI. It utilizes Lang chain for conversational AI, integrates technologies like Python, OpenAI API, and Ngrock for simulated server, and employs Flask Server for API communication. The project's objective is to provide small business professionals with a team of AI assistants capable of connecting to data sources and offering valuable assistance. Users can easily interact with the team through a dedicated Slack channel, leveraging their individual strengths and knowledge domains.
