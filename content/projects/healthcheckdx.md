HealthCheckDX is a registration site for an at-home health solution, developed using .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and SQL Server. The site enables clients to conveniently gain health insights without leaving their homes. Clients receive a kit with instructions and can register it through the app. The app generates lab intake forms for respective tests and allows printing of shipping labels. Email notifications provide updates on kit status. Lab results are stored on an Azure server, and clients receive email notifications to view and print PDF results from their dashboard. The project offers a seamless, home-based health testing experience.
